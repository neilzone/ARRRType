1,"If sailor tales to sailor tunes, Storm and adventure, heat and cold, If schooners, islands, and maroons And Buccaneers and buried Gold, And all the old romance, retold Exactly in the ancient way, Can please, as me they pleased of old, The wiser youngsters of to-day: So be it, and fall on!"
2,"Squire Trelawney, Doctor Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17-, and go back to the time when my father kept the ""Admiral Benbow"" Inn, and the brown old seaman, with the saber cut, first took up his lodging under our roof."
3,"I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow; a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man; his tarry pig-tail falling over the shoulders of his soiled blue coat; his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the saber cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white."
4,"I remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards: ""Fifteen men on the dead man's chest, Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!"""
5,"In the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared, called roughly for a glass of rum."
6,"This, when it was brought to him, he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste, and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard. ""This is a handy cove,"" says he, at length; ""and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop. Much company, mate?"""
7,"My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity. ""Well, then,"" said he, ""this is the berth for me. Here you, matey,"" he cried to the man who trundled the barrow; ""bring up alongside and help up my chest. I'll stay here a bit,"" he continued."
8,"""I'm a plain man; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch ships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I see what you're at-there""; and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold."
9,"""You can tell me when I've worked through that,"" said he, looking as fierce as a commander. And, indeed, bad as his clothes were, and coarsely as he spoke, he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like a mate or skipper, accustomed to be obeyed or to strike."
10,"The man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the ""Royal George""; that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as lonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence."
11,"And that was all we could learn of our guest. He was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove, or upon the cliffs, with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner of the parlor next the fire, and drank rum and water very strong."
12,"Mostly he would not speak when spoken to; only look up sudden and fierce, and blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be. Every day, when he came back from his stroll, he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road."
13,"When a seaman put up at the ""Admiral Benbow"" (as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol), he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlor; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present."
14,"For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter; for I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I would only keep my ""weather eye open for a seafaring man with one leg,"" and let him know the moment he appeared."
15,"Often enough when the first of the month came round, and I applied to him for my wage, he would only blow through his nose at me, and stare me down; but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my fourpenny piece, and repeat his orders to look out for ""the seafaring man with one leg."""
16,"How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you. On stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house, and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions."
17,"And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies. But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him."
18,"There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call for glasses round, and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing."
19,"Often I have heard the house shaking with ""Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum,"" all the neighbors joining in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark."
20,"For in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for silence all around; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question, or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not following his story."
21,"Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed. His stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories they were; about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main."
22,"By his own account, he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea; and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described."
23,"People were frightened at the time, but on looking back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life; and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him, calling him a ""true sea-dog,"" and a ""real old salt,"" and such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England terrible at sea."
24,"I remember the appearance of his coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before the end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter, and he never spoke with any but the neighbors, and with these, for the most part, only when drunk on rum."
78,"Now, if I can't get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind you, it's my old sea-chest they're after; you get on a horse-you can, can't you?"
25,"I followed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright doctor, with his powder as white as snow, and his bright, black eyes and pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all, with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting far gone in rum, with his arms on the table."
26,"Suddenly he-the captain, that is-began to pipe up his eternal song: ""Fifteen men on the dead man's chest- Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum! Drink and the devil had done for the rest- Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!"""
27,"At first I had supposed ""the dead man's chest"" to be that identical big box of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man."
28,"In the meantime the captain gradually brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean-silence. The voices stopped at once, all but Doctor Livesey's; he went on as before, speaking clear and kind, and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two."
29,"The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again, glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous oath: ""Silence, there, between decks!"""
30,"""Were you addressing me, sir?"" said the doctor; and when the ruffian had told him, with another oath, that this was so, replied, ""I have only one thing to say to you, sir, that if you keep on drinking rum, the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!"" The old fellow's fury was awful."
31,"He sprang to his feet, drew and opened a sailor's clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand, threatened to pin the doctor to the wall. The doctor never so much as moved."
32,"He spoke to him, as before, over his shoulder, and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the room might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: ""If you do not put that knife this instant into your pocket, I promise, upon my honor, you shall hang at the next assizes."""
33,"Then followed a battle of looks between them; but the captain soon knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like a beaten dog. ""And now, sir,"" continued the doctor, ""since I now know there's such a fellow in my district, you may count I'll have an eye upon you day and night."
34,"I'm not a doctor only, I'm a magistrate; and if I catch a breath of complaint against you, if it's only for a piece of incivility like to-night's, I'll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed out of this. Let that suffice."""
35,"Soon after Doctor Livesey's horse came to the door and he rode away, but the captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come. It was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you will see, of his affairs."
36,"It was one January morning, very early-a pinching, frosty morning-the cove all gray with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones, the sun still low, and only touching the hill-tops and shining far to seaward."
37,"The captain had risen earlier than usual, and set out down the beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat, his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head."
38,"I remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and the last sound I heard of him, as he turned the big rock, was a loud snort of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Doctor Livesey."
39,"Well, mother was upstairs with father, and I was laying the breakfast table against the captain's return, when the parlor door opened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. He was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand; and, though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter."
40,"I had always my eyes open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I remember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too."
41,"I asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum, but as I was going out of the room to fetch it he sat down upon a table and motioned to me to draw near. I paused where I was, with my napkin in my hand."
42,"""Come here, sonny,"" said he. ""Come nearer here."" I took a step nearer. ""Is this here table for my mate Bill?"" he asked, with a kind of leer. I told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for a person who stayed at our house, whom we called the captain."
43,"""Well,"" said he, ""my mate Bill would be called the captain, as like as not. He has a cut on one cheek, and a mighty pleasant way with him, particularly in drink, has my mate Bill. We'll put it, for argument like, that your captain has a cut on one cheek-and we'll put it, if you like, that that cheek's the right one."
44,"Ah, well! I told you. Now, is my mate Bill in this here house?"" I told him he was out walking. ""Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?"" And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions."
45,"The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no affair of mine, I thought; and, besides, it was difficult to know what to do."
46,"The stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once I stepped out myself into the road, but he immediately called me back, and, as I did not obey quick enough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face, and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump."
47,"As soon as I was back again he returned to his former manner, half-fawning, half-sneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy, and he had taken quite a fancy to me. ""I have a son of my own,"" said he, ""as like you as two blocks, and he's all the pride of my 'art."
48,"But the great thing for boys is discipline, sonny-discipline. Now, if you had sailed along of Bill, you wouldn't have stood there to be spoke to twice-not you. That was never Bill's way, nor the way of sich as sailed with him."
49,"And here, sure enough, is my mate Bill, with a spy-glass under his arm, bless his old 'art, to be sure. You and me'll just go back into the parlor, sonny, and get behind the door, and we'll give Bill a little surprise-bless his 'art, I say again."
50,"So saying, the stranger backed along with me into the parlor, and put me behind him into the corner, so that we were both hidden by the open door. I was very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself."
51,"He cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath, and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call a lump in the throat."
52,"At last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind him, without looking to the right or left, and marched straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him. ""Bill,"" said the stranger, in a voice that I thought he had tried to make bold and big."
53,"The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a man who sees a ghost, or the Evil One, or something worse, if anything can be; and, upon my word, I felt sorry to see him, all in a moment, turn so old and sick."
54,"""Come, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill, surely,"" said the stranger. The captain made a sort of gasp. ""Black Dog!"" said he. ""And who else?"" returned the other, getting more at his ease. ""Black Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate, Billy, at the Admiral Benbow Inn."""
55,"When I returned with the rum they were already seated on either side of the captain's breakfast table-Black Dog next to the door, and sitting sideways, so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I thought, on his retreat. He bade me go and leave the door wide open."
56,"""None of your keyholes for me, sonny,"" he said, and I left them together and retired into the bar. For a long time, though I certainly did my best to listen, I could hear nothing but a low gabbling; but at last the voices began to grow higher, and I could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain."
57,"Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and other noises; the chair and table went over in a lump, a clash of steel followed, and then a cry of pain, and the next instant I saw Black Dog in full flight, and the captain hotly pursuing, both with drawn cutlasses, and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder."
58,"Just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous cut, which would certainly have split him to the chin had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow. You may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to this day."
59,"That blow was the last of the battle. Once out upon the road, Black Dog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful clean pair of heels, and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute. The captain, for his part, stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man."
60,"Then he passed his hand over his eyes several times, and at last turned back into the house. ""Jim,"" says he, ""rum""; and as he spoke he reeled a little, and caught himself with one hand against the wall. ""Are you hurt?"" cried I. ""Rum,"" he repeated."
61,"""I must get away from here. Rum! rum!"" I ran to fetch it, but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out, and I broke one glass and fouled the tap, and while I was still getting in my own way, I heard a loud fall in the parlor, and, running in, beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor."
62,"At the same instant my mother, alarmed by the cries and fighting, came running downstairs to help me. Between us we raised his head. He was breathing very loud and hard, but his eyes were closed and his face was a horrible color. ""Dear, deary me!"""
63,"I got the rum, to be sure, and tried to put it down his throat, but his teeth were tightly shut, and his jaws as strong as iron. It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came in, on his visit to my father."
64,"""For my part, I must do my best to save this fellow's trebly worthless life; and, Jim, you get me a basin."" When I got back with the basin the doctor had already ripped up the captain's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm. It was tattooed in several places."
65,"A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved. But suddenly his color changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying: ""Where's Black Dog?"""
66,"""Now, Mr. Bones-"" ""That's not my name,"" he interrupted. ""Much I care,"" returned the doctor."
67,"""It's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance, and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I have to say to you is this: One glass of rum won't kill you, but if you take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you don't break off short, you'll die-do you understand that?-die, and go to your own place, like the man in the Bible."
68,"""Come, now, make an effort. I'll help you to your bed for once."" Between us, with much trouble, we managed to hoist him upstairs, and laid him on his bed, where his head fell back on the pillow, as if he were almost fainting."
69,"""I have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile; he should lie for a week where he is-that is the best thing for him and you, but another stroke would settle him."" About noon I stopped at the captain's door with some cooling drinks and medicines."
70,"He was lying very much as we had left him, only a little higher, and he seemed both weak and excited. ""Jim,"" he said, ""you're the only one here that's worth anything; and you know I've always been good to you. Never a month but I've given you a silver fourpenny for yourself."""
71,"""And now you see, mate, I'm pretty low, and deserted by all; and, Jim, you'll bring me one noggin of rum, now, won't you, matey?"" ""The doctor-"" I began. But he broke in, cursing the doctor in a feeble voice, but heartily."
72,"I seen old Flint in the corner there, behind you; as plain as print, I seen him; and if I get the horrors, I'm a man that has lived rough, and I'll raise Cain. Your doctor hisself said one glass wouldn't hurt me. I'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin, Jim."
73,"He was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me, for my father, who was very low that day, needed quiet; besides, I was reassured by the doctor's words, now quoted to me, and rather offended by the offer of a bribe."
74,"And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?"" ""A week at least,"" said I. ""Thunder!"" he cried. ""A week! I can't do that; they'd have the black spot on me by then."""
75,"I never wasted good money of mine, nor lost it neither; and I'll trick 'em again. I'm not afraid on 'em. I'll shake out another reef, matey, and daddle 'em again."" As he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great difficulty, holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out, and moving his legs like so much dead weight."
76,"His words, spirited as they were in meaning, contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered. He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge. ""That doctor's done me,"" he murmured. ""My ears is singing. Lay me back."""
77,"Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place, where he lay for a while silent. ""Jim,"" he said, at length, ""you saw that seafaring man to-day?"" ""Black Dog?"" I asked. ""Ah! Black Dog,"" said he. ""He's a bad 'un; but there's worse that put him on."""
79,"Well, then, you get on a horse and go to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all hands-magistrates and sich-and he'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow - all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em that's left."
80,"I was first mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I'm the only one as knows the place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I was to now, you see."
81,"""But you won't peach unless they get the black spot on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again, or a seafaring man with one leg, Jim-him above all."" ""But what is the black spot, captain?"" I asked. ""That's a summons, mate. I'll tell you if they get that."
82,"But you keep your weather-eye open, Jim, and I'll share with you equals, upon my honor."" He wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after I had given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark, ""If ever a seaman wanted drugs, it's me,"" he fell at last into a heavy, swoon-like sleep, in which I left him."
83,What I should have done had all gone well I do not know. Probably I should have told the whole story to the doctor; for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me.
84,"But as things fell out, my poor father died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters on one side. Our natural distress, the visits of the neighbors, the arranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile, kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of the captain, far less to be afraid of him."
85,"He got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual, though he ate little, and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply of rum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing through his nose, and no one dared to cross him."
86,"I have said the captain was weak, and indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than to regain his strength. He clambered up and down stairs, and went from the parlor to the bar and back again, and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on to the walls as he went for support, and breathing hard and fast, like a man on a steep mountain."
87,"He never particularly addressed me, and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper was more flighty, and, allowing for his bodily weakness, more violent than ever. He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table."
88,"But, with all that, he minded people less, and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather wandering. Once, for instance, to our extreme wonder, he piped up to a different air, a kind of country love-song, that he must have learned in his youth before he had begun to follow the sea."
89,"So things passed until the day after the funeral and about three o'clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I was standing at the door for a moment, full of sad thoughts about my father, when I saw someone drawing slowly near along the road."
90,"He was plainly blind, for he tapped before him with a stick, and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a huge old tattered sea-cloak with a hood that made him appear positively deformed."
91,"I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure. He stopped a little from the inn and, raising his voice in an odd sing-song, addressed the air in front of him: ""Will any kind friend inform a poor blind man, who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defense of his native country, England, and God bless King George!-where or in what part of this country he may now be?"""
92,"I never heard a voice so cruel, and cold, and ugly as that blind man's. It cowed me more than the pain, and I began to obey him at once, walking straight in at the door and towards the parlor, where the sick old buccaneer was sitting, dazed with rum."
93,"The blind man clung close to me, holding me in one iron fist, and leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry. ""Lead me straight up to him, and when I'm in view, cry out, Here's a friend for you, Bill."""
94,"The poor captain raised his eyes, and at one look the rum went out of him and left him staring sober. The expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness. He made a movement to rise, but I do not believe he had enough force left in his body."
95,"We both obeyed him to the letter, and I saw him pass something from the hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain's, which closed upon it instantly."
96,"""And now that's done,"" said the blind man, and at the words he suddenly left hold of me, and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness, skipped out of the parlor and into the road, where, as I stood motionless, I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance."
97,"It was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather our senses; but at length, and about the same moment, I released his wrist, which I was still holding, and he drew in his hand, and looked sharply into the palm. ""Ten o'clock!"" he cried. ""Six hours!"
98,"Some of the man's money - if he had any-was certainly due to us, but it was not likely that our captain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by me - Black Dog and the blind beggar - would be inclined to give up their booty in payment of the dead man's debts."
99,"The captain's order to mount at once and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected, which was not to be thought of. Indeed, it seemed impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house; the fall of coals in the kitchen grate, the very ticking of the clock, filled us with alarm."
100,"The neighborhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by approaching footsteps; and what between the dead body of the captain on the parlor floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand and ready to return, there were moments when, as the saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror."
